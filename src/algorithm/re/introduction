Pattern matching: Find one of a specified set of strings in text.

1. Duality between REs and DFAs
① Definition
1) RE: Concise way to describe a set of strings
2) DFA: Machine to recognize whether a given string is in a given set.
②Kleene's theorem
1) For any DFA, there exists a RE that describe the same set of stirngs.
2) For any RE, there exists a DFA that recognizeds the same set of strings.

2. Pattern Matching Implementation
①DirectedDFS
Use DirectedGraph to find all vertices reachable from a given source or set of vertices.
②Build an NFA corresponding to an RE
1) Add match-transition edge from state corresponding to characters int eh alphabet to next state.
2) Add σ-transition edge from parentheses to next state.
3) Add three σ-transition edges for each * operator.
4) Add two σ-transition edges for each | operator.
