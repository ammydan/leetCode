1、Algorithm:
A problem by
①dividing it into smaller subproblems of the same type;
②solving(recursively or iteratively) each subproblem; and
③combining solutions to subproblems to get solutions to the original problem.

2、The Master Theorem
T(n) = aT(n/b)+f(n)
c = log_b a;
a>=1, b>0, f(n)>0.
①if  f(n) == O(n^(c-Ω), then T(n)=θ(n^c) for some Ω.
②if f(n) == θ(n^c(logn)^k), k>=0, then T(n)=θ(n^c(logn)^k)
